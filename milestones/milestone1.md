## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We ideated the problem statement and tried to relate it with our daily lives. As students we often find it difficult tracking expenses in our busy daily lives so we thought of creating this budget app to be our lightweight budget tracking buddy

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We struggled a little on the user stories because we had to cover multiple lenses. Also with only 2 members in the group, We had increased workload without the third member to help the group out.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Integrating external API's and looking into how we can learn and integrate ORM's in our project.
