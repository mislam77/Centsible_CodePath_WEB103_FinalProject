## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to effectively collaborate on the wireframes and entity relationship diagrams. Our communication was clear, and we managed to divide the tasks efficiently.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Since it was midterms week for us, we had minimal to time to work on the wireframes and entity relationship diagrams together. Also with only 2 members, we had increased workload without the third member to help the group out.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We might need to use an ORM like Prisma for our project to better define the database.
