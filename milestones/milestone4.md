## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

we enjoyed the auth demo and even implemented the demo ourselves    

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

both of us are preoccupied with school work as well as interviews which is why we havent made any substantial progress on our project.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We were able to successfully implement authentication, next we plan to initialize database and set up routes to perform GET and POST requests to backend. Then we plan on working on the frontend.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Probably the charts, because those require some careful hunting for different chart libraries and implementing them correctly.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Not much other than the lectures and TA help sessions.
