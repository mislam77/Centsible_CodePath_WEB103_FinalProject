## About

### Description and Purpose

Centsible is an intuitive, full-stack web app designed to provide users with a streamlined way to manage daily expenses and gain financial clarity. With its easy-to-use interface, users can quickly log expenditures, categorize them (like food, travel, entertainment), and generate visual summaries to monitor spending patterns. The app offers customization options, allowing users to create their own categories, set personalized spending limits, and get notified when they approach their budget cap. 

The goal of Centsible is to make budgeting simple, smart, and tailored to usersâ€™ unique lifestyles. It's not just about tracking expenses, but about helping users stay financially empowered. Whether saving for a big goal or simply keeping spending in check, the app provides real-time insights, encourages better financial habits, and helps users make mindful decisions. By demystifying personal finance and providing actionable data, Centsible makes it easier to achieve long-term financial wellness.

### Inspiration

Centsible is inspired by the idea that financial health is a key component of overall well-being. Managing money can be daunting, especially for young adults, students, and individuals new to budgeting. Centsible aims to simplify the process, remove the stress, and empower users to take control of their finances with confidence. The app is designed to be user-friendly, visually engaging, and informative, providing a positive experience that motivates users to build better money habits. By combining practicality with personalization, Centsible fosters a sense of financial awareness, responsibility, and success.
